3.1 Design a basic hash function, keeping in mind memory contraints and how you would deal with hash collisions.
Using the modulo operator, with k being an integer key and N representing a prime number, the hash function could be: 
h(k) = k mod N 
A way to handle the hash collisions would be linear probing.

3.2 Walkthrough your function with an example where there is no hash collision.
If the key k = 12
and N = 5

h(12) = 12 mod 5 = 2
