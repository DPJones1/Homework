Theory questions:
1. SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
2. An exception called 'Division by Zero' is thrown as division by 0 cannot be done
3. 'git push' will move code into your repository 
4. NULL represents that the value is unknown or cannot be found with the code which has been placed into the program.
5. The Scrum Master facilitates in the scrum events to ensure that they are understood and followed by the scrum team such as the stand-up, planning and reviews. The Scrum master is also there for guidance and aiding with decision making for the scrum team, and if needed protects the scrum team to ensure no external influences disrupt the team. 
6. Logging: This involves printing particular messages in the code when it hits potential expected errors and issues. This would be used when you are trying to find out the cause of an error or issue running within your code and you might need to collect this data to analyse. Another debugging method is: Breakpoints, the breakpoints within the code stop it from continuing to work allowing to clearly see where the code is running into issues, breakpoints are commonly used within IDE's, you would predominantly use breakpoints when you suspect that there are errors arising at a particular part within your code and you don't want the programme to continue running.
7. An error that could be thrown when this code block runs is if a string value was inserted instead of a numerical value, in which case a TypeError exception could be raised after the code block 'except TypeError('Input a numerical value)' to show the user what value needs to be inputted.
8. Git branching: A branch allows separate lines of code to be created which is independent from the main repository this is useful so that whilst the code is being worked on the main repository will remain unaffected. When you create a branch on GitHub you can either do this through your terminal or on the GitHub repository page, once you have made your changes to your branch, you might then want to share this with the collaborators on the main repository you can do this by creating a pull request with your suggestions on what to include within the main repository. Within this pull request others can leave comments and reviews for you to work together on. Once the changes are agreed, they can be merged onto the selected branch. GitHub branching allows an easy tracking of changes that have taken place in the repository essential for when working in teams.
9. a. List of requirements:
 - Application presentation
 - Prices 
 - Allergen information 
 - Descriptions of dishes
 - Customer registration
 - Order number for customer
 - Order integration with kitchen display unit
 - Payment processing 
 - Analytics for stock purposes
 - Notifications
 b. Main considerations and potential problems:
 - To flag for particular allergen information, whether there is a symbol or a text box that opens to ask the customer 
 - If there are particular deals running to ensure that these are calculated at checkout
 - The user experience being a smooth and clear one 
 - That the programme can be used on different interfaces
 - Security of personal details 
 - Accessibility 
 - Budget
c. Components or tools to use:
 - Front-end development: using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the system the user will interact with
 - Back-end development: Using programming language such as Python, a database such as MySQL to store all data to be called upon, connecting to other businesses who process payments.
 - Payments processors
 - Analytics such as Google Analytics to see how the users interact with the page and what is most popular 
 - Notifications: Emailing to provide order confirmation and updates could use services like HubSpot
